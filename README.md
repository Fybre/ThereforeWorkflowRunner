# ThereforeWorkflowRunner
The Therefore Workflow Runner system provides the capability to schedule a recurring workflow task in the Therefore Document Management System. This allows a workflow to be repeated indefinitely without requiring any loops to be configured in the Therefore workflow itself.

The system also enables a workflow to be triggered from a Xero Webhook notification. This allows a workflow to be run immediately after an addition/change in Xero, without requiring polling. Xero Webhooks require configuration through the Xero Developer site.

All functions require an API Authorisation Key to be submitted with the request.
